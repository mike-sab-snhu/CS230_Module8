Module 8 Assignment

=Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    The Gaming Room is making a pictionary like game where players will be challenged to guess a word and receive hints via images.

=What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

    I think I did a good job or analyzing the problem from the perspective of a consultant by focusing on matters such as cost to the client, follow-on
    work, and the end-user's experience.

=What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

    I found the part of the design document that forces us to connect our design choices to the client's needs is important and very helpful because it
    keeps us from over-engineering a solution.  We give the client just what they need without losing site of their vision.

=If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    I would improve on the part of the document that detailed the technical plans.  I feel I could've included more in-depth technical planning so that
    anyone reading it would have a better idea of how I aimed to solved the problem on a granular level.

=How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    I interpreted the client's needs by thinking about what clients have needed from me in the past, what obstacles emerged, and what worked best to 
    create the most effectve solution.  The client's demands were so vague it was easy to make a mistake so past experience was very helpful here.

=How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

    I felt that building the software on a .Net framework was best as it would allow the team to reach the largeset audience with the least 
    labor-investment.  In the future, I would focus on solving problems using cloud platforms like Azure to see how I could offer the client a solution
    that was more in line with common practices employed by competitors.
